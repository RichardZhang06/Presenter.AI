Setup:
npm init -y
npm install express socket.io cors
node server.js
Should see "Backend running on http://localhost:5000"

npm install socket.io-client
npm install react react-dom

Version Control:
1. Work on your own branch.

2. When ready to push local changes, first sync with main to avoid conflicts.
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout (BRANCHNAME)
git merge main

3. Then, push your branch onto GitHub (different than pushing directly to main since pull requests need to be approved first).
git push origin (BRANCHNAME)

4. Submit it a pull request on GitHub.

5. Once approved by someone else, merge it into main.
